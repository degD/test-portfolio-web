<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>Amazing movie. Both philosophical and action. Enjoyed every second of it. The ending was cool too.</p>

<h3>Blade Runner: 2049</h3>
<p>
    An adaptation movie based on the stories of Philip K. Dick. His most well-known book is "Do Androids Dream of
    Electric Sheep?".
    A very fast-paced movie. And some parts are a bit confusing. But overall, one of my favorite movies.
